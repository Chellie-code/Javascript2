        <h1>WHO WAS ADA  LOVELACE, THE WOMAN WHO INVENTED PROGRAMMING?</h1>

            <p>A woman was behind the idea which was a turning point in creating today's world in which we work, play and live: Ada Lovelace invented programming, marking the beginning of the Digital Revolution that today allows us to do everthing we now do in our modern day to day lives. </p>

            <p>Ada Lovelace was born in 1815, and was the only daughter of the British writer Lord Byron, who died of illness while fighting in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was 8 years old.</p>
            <p>Under the care of her mother Annabella Milbanke, Ada Lovelace began studying under the guidance of a tutor who introduced her to, and guided her through, the world of mathematics, something which was incredibly rare at the time.</p>
            <p>At the age of 17 Ada met one of the forefathers of modern programming: Charles Babbage, the inventor of a mechanical calculator capable of performing numerical functions using finite difference methods. </p>
            <p>Years later, Ada Lovelace mader her second leap into the world of mathematics: she translated and expanded upon the ideas proposed by the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea, after he described his interpretation of an Analytical Engine(an automatic calculating machine).</p>
            <p>Lovelace's paper tripled the length of the original work.</p>

            <h2>Some of Ada's Critiques</h2>
            <p>Lovelace indicated in her paper that the machine would be capable of solving mathematical problems using sequences of operations which could even make use of symbols in addition to numbers.</p>
            <p>This was the first bridge between calculation and programming, and without realising it the foundations for the technology we use today were created.</p>
